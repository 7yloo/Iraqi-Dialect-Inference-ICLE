# 🇮🇶 ICLE: Deciphering Iraqi "Hussja OR Husscha" via Hybrid AI

Welcome to the official repository of the **ICLE Framework** (Intuitive Cultural & Logical Engine). This project addresses the "Cultural Hallucination" in global AI models when processing the Iraqi dialect.

## 📊 Performance Benchmark
Our testing shows a massive gap between ICLE and global models in understanding Iraqi sarcasm and social nuances.

| Model | Total Accuracy | Sarcasm (Hussja) | Polite Refusal |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **ICLE (Our Framework)** | **91%** | **89%** | **94%** |
| GPT-4 Turbo | 40% | 35% | 18% |
| Gemini 1.5 Pro | 34% | 28% | 12% |

## 📁 Repository Contents
- **`Iraqi_Golden_Dataset_V3.json`**: Hand-annotated dataset of 191 unique Iraqi social scenarios.
- **`ICLE_Paper.pdf`**: Technical paper explaining the methodology and failure analysis of LLMs.
- **`icle_bot.py`**: Implementation of the Hybrid search and inference engine.

## 💡 Why ICLE?
Global models like Gemini fail in Iraq because they interpret language **literally**. ICLE uses a "Golden Path" to bridge the gap between what is **said** and what is **meant**.



Note on Dataset: The full "Iraqi Golden Dataset V3" (191 unique scenarios) is a proprietary research asset. A small sample is provided for structural reference. For academic collaborations or access to the full dataset, please contact the author
